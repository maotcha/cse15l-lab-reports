# Week 8 Lab Report
This is something related to debugging? I don't really know anymore, it's week 8 and I'm running on some combination of Shin ramen and cute cat videos. Pray for me.

## Github Repositories
Here is the [link](https://github.com/maotcha/markdown-parse) to my repository, and here's another [link](https://github.com/maotcha/markdownparse2) to the repository I reviewed.

## Snippet 1
According to VScode preview, when `MarkdownParse.java` is run with the first snippet, the `ArrayList` returned from `getLinks()` should look like this: ```[`google.com, google.com, ucsd.edu]```.

![snippet1 test]()

This is the test I wrote for snippet 1 in `MarkdownParseTest.java` based on the expected output. I'm using this test for my program and the one I'm reviewing.

![running own test]()

Here is the results from me running my test on my own program. As you can see, my program didn't pass the test, and you can see the specific JUnit output saying so below:
![JUnit snippit 1 own test failure]()

![running other test]()

The results from running my test on the other program is shown above. As you can see, that program didn't pass the test either, and you can see the specific JUnit output saying so below:
![JUnit snippit 1 other test failure]()
