# Week 6 Lab Report
This week's lab report is all about streamlining my ssh configuration. I can't think of anything else to say! So I won't!

## Streamlining ssh Configuration

![config](https://maotcha.github.io/cse15l-lab-reports/config.png)

This is my config file, and I'm using my MacBook's TextEdit program to edit it. For simplicty and ease of memorization (and maybe lack of creativity), I've chosen "cs15" as my alias.

Here's an example of me connecting to my ieng6 account using the command `ssh cs15`. Oh man! So much faster than trying to remember and correctly type out my whole account!

Here's an example of me copying a random java file to my ieng6 account using `scp students.java cs15:~/`. Again, the process is a lot faster than having to type out my whole account name. Now if only I could find a way to not have to type out `:~/`.
